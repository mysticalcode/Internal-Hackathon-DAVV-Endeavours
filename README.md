# Sentiment-analysis-from-text-feedback
 The ml model will classify the reviews into positive and negative reviews and based on that it will generate the average rating of the product. the architecture used here is RNN(Recurrent Neural Network).   
 The Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset contains product reviews taken from Amazon.com from many product types (domains).     http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
 # About-Dataset
 This dataset contains several million reviews of Amazon products, with the reviews separated into two classes for positive and negative reviews. The two classes are evenly balanced here.

This is a large dataset, and the version that I am using here only has the text as a feature with no other metadata. This makes this an interesting dataset for doing NLP work. It is data written by users, so it's like that there are various typos, nonstandard spellings, and other variations that you may not find in curated sets of published text.
